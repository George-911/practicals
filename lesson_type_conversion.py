# Create a variable called 'price' as a string with the value '19.99'.

# Convert 'price' to a float and store it in a new variable called 'price_float'.

# Create a variable called 'quantity' as an integer with a value of 5.

# Calculate the total cost by multiplying 'price_float' and 'quantity' and store it in a variable called total_cost.

# Covert the total_cost to an integer {round down} and store it in a variable called 'total_cost_int'

# Print out 'price', 'price_float', 'quantity', 'total_cost' and 'total_cost_int'
